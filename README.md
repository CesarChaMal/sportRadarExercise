## Design Patterns, Principles and Good Practices

The library utilizes several design patterns and adheres to SOLID principles to ensure code quality, readability, and maintainability:

### Design Patterns

- **Builder Pattern**: Facilitates constructing complex `Match` objects. This pattern is crucial for creating instances with multiple parameters, avoiding confusion with multiple constructors.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Enables the instantiation of `Match` objects with pre-defined configurations, allowing for flexibility in creating matches for different types of sports.
- **Observer Pattern**: Supports notifying interested parties of changes in match states, ensuring that components such as the scoreboard UI are updated in real time.
- **Command Pattern**: Used to encapsulate all requests to the scoreboard as executable commands, allowing for undo operations and logging changes. Modern Spring Boot implementation provides database-aware commands with full undo capability.
- **State Pattern**: Manages changes in match state (e.g., from not started, in progress, to finished) in a robust and extensible manner.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Employs flexible scoring strategies that can adapt to various game rules or phases, such as regular time or extra time. The library implements **three distinct strategy approaches**:
  - **Classic Strategy Pattern**: Traditional OOP approach with `ScoringStrategy` interface
  - **Functional Strategy 1**: Using `BiConsumer<Match, int[]>` for functional programming approach
  - **Functional Strategy 2**: Enum-based strategy selection with `ScoringStrategyType` for type-safe functional dispatch
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures there is a single instance of the Scoreboard class throughout the application, providing a global point of access to it. This pattern is used to control scoreboard interactions and maintain a consistent state across different parts of the system.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Enhances or modifies the behavior of Match objects during overtime without altering the original classes. This pattern allows the addition of new functionalities such as different scoring strategies or rules specific to overtime periods. Specific implementations like FootballMatchOvertime or BasketballMatchOvertime can extend from base decorator implementations to encapsulate and augment behaviors dynamically.

### SOLID Principles

The design and implementation strive to adhere to SOLID principles for object-oriented design, focusing on:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

### Recommendations from Effective Java

- **Consider static factory methods instead of constructors**: Provides clarity and flexibility in instance creation. Applied in the creation of scoring strategies and state transitions.
- **Use Builder when faced with many constructor parameters**: Applied in the creation of `Match` instances, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Favor composition over inheritance**: Ensures the system remains flexible and prevents issues related to tight coupling.
- **Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it**: The library's core classes are designed to be easily extendable or securely closed for modification.
- **Prefer interfaces to abstract classes**: Allows the library to define multiple implementations for strategies and states, adhering to the open/closed principle.
- **Prefer lists to arrays**: Lists provide more flexibility and safety, and are used throughout the library for managing collections of matches and observers.
- **Use of Immutable Collections**: To prevent unintended modifications, `Collections.unmodifiableList` is used when returning lists from the library's methods.
- **Use Enum instead of int constants**: Enums are used for defining types and options that are known at compile time to ensure type safety and clarity.
- **Pattern Matching with instanceof**: Leverages Java 16+ pattern matching for cleaner type checking and casting.
- **EnumMap for Performance**: Uses `EnumMap` for optimal enum-based lookups in strategy dispatch.

### Utilization of Functional Programming

This library incorporates functional programming principles to enhance readability, maintainability, and code efficiency:

- **Multiple Strategy Implementations**: Three different approaches to strategy pattern implementation, showcasing both OOP and functional programming paradigms
- **EnumMap Strategy Dispatch**: High-performance strategy selection using `EnumMap<ScoringStrategyMode, BiConsumer<Integer, Integer>>`
- **Method References**: Extensive use of method references (`this::applyScoringStrategy`) for cleaner code
- **Pattern Matching**: Utilizes Java 16+ pattern matching with instanceof for cleaner type checking
- **Comparator Chains**: Utilizes `Comparator` chains for sorting matches, leveraging lambda expressions and method references for concise and readable sorting logic.
- **Optional**: Employs `Optional` for safe retrieval of matches, minimizing the risk of `NullPointerException` and simplifying conditional logic.
- **Stream API**: Leverages the Stream API for filtering and collecting matches, showcasing the power of streams in processing collections.
- **Functional Strategy Selection**: Dynamic strategy selection based on runtime criteria using functional interfaces

### Advanced State Management
- **MatchStateManager**: Centralized state management with EnumMap-based strategy dispatch for optimal performance
- **Map-based State Transitions**: O(1) lookup performance for state-to-event mapping
- **Concurrent State Handling**: Thread-safe state transitions with fine-grained locking

### Synchronization Techniques
- **Fine-Grained Locking**: Utilizes more precise locking mechanisms to allow for more concurrent operations while reducing bottlenecks.
- **ReentrantLock**: Strategic use of reentrant locks for thread-safe operations
- **Atomic Operations**: Uses atomic variables and operations to manage critical sections of the scoreboard without locking, enhancing efficiency.
- **Concurrent Data Structures**: Implements thread-safe collections and structures for managing matches and their scores effectively.
- **Semaphores**: Utilizes semaphores to control access to resources by multiple threads, preventing race conditions and ensuring that only a fixed number of threads can access match starting functions simultaneously (max 5 concurrent match starts).
- **Executor Services and Futures**: Manages thread execution and resource allocation through executor services, providing a framework for asynchronous task execution. Futures are used to track the progress and results of asynchronous computations, enabling efficient data handling and state management without blocking the main application thread.

### Benefits
These synchronization techniques are integrated into the library to ensure robust thread safety and to enhance the applicationâ€™s scalability and responsiveness, particularly in environments with high concurrency demands.

## Development Approach

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Development began with writing tests for each functionality, ensuring each piece of code is properly tested before implementation.
- **Clean Code**: Effort was made to write readable, simple, and refactored code to enhance maintainability and understandability.
- **Modern Java Features**: Utilizes Java 22 features including pattern matching, records, enhanced switch expressions, and advanced functional programming constructs.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit tests, integration tests, concurrency tests, and error handling scenarios for robust validation.

### Starting a Match

You can start a match by directly creating a `Match` object with a factory or by using the `Scoreboard` class to manage it for you.

```java
// Use Singleton pattern for Scoreboard
Scoreboard scoreboard = Scoreboard.getInstance(new FootballMatchFactory());
MatchFactory footballMatchFactory = new FootballMatchFactory();

// Create teams for the football match
Team<FootballPlayer> homeFootballTeam = new FootballTeam.Builder().name("Home Football Team").build();
Team<FootballPlayer> awayFootballTeam = new FootballTeam.Builder().name("Away Football Team").build();

// Start a football match
MatchFactory<FootballMatch> footballMatchFactory = new FootballMatchFactory();
MatchInterface footballMatch = footballMatchFactory.createMatchBuilder(homeFootballTeam, awayFootballTeam).build();
scoreboard.addMatch(footballMatch);

// Create teams for the basketball match
Team<BasketballPlayer> homeBasketballTeam = new BasketballTeam.Builder().name("Home Basketball Team").build();
Team<BasketballPlayer> awayBasketballTeam = new BasketballTeam.Builder().name("Away Basketball Team").build();

// Start a basketball match
MatchFactory<BasketballMatch> basketballMatchFactory = new BasketballMatchFactory();
MatchInterface basketballMatch = basketballMatchFactory.createMatchBuilder(homeBasketballTeam, awayBasketballTeam).build();
scoreboard.addMatch(basketballMatch);

// Start a football match with a specific scoring strategy mode
MatchInterface footballMatch = footballMatchFactory.createMatchBuilder(homeFootballTeam, awayFootballTeam)
                                            .scoringStrategyMode(ScoringStrategyMode.CLASSIC) // or FUNCTIONAL1, FUNCTIONAL2
                                            .build();
scoreboard.addMatch(footballMatch);

// Start a match using the classic strategy pattern
MatchInterface match = footballMatchFactory.createMatchBuilder(homeFootballTeam, awayFootballTeam)
                                            .scoringStrategyMode(ScoringStrategyMode.CLASSIC) 
                                            .scoringStrategy(ScoringStrategy.forFootballNormalTime())
                                            .build();
scoreboard.addMatch(match);

// Start a match using the first functional strategy approach
MatchInterface match = footballMatchFactory.createMatchBuilder(homeFootballTeam, awayFootballTeam)
                                            .scoringStrategyMode(ScoringStrategyMode.FUNCTIONAL1) 
                                            .scoringStrategyFunctional1(ScoringStrategiesFunctional1.footballNormalTimeScoringStrategy)
                                            .build();
scoreboard.addMatch(match);

// Start a match using the second functional strategy approach with enums
MatchInterface match = footballMatchFactory.createMatchBuilder(homeFootballTeam, awayFootballTeam)
                                            .scoringStrategyMode(ScoringStrategyMode.FUNCTIONAL2) 
                                            .scoringStrategyFunctional2(ScoringStrategyType.FOOTBALL_NORMAL_TIME)
                                            .build();
scoreboard.addMatch(match);

// Switch to extra time scoring strategy for a match using the classic strategy
matchClassic.setScoringStrategy(ScoringStrategy.forFootballExtraTime());

// For functional strategy 1
matchFunctional1.setScoringStrategyFunctional1(ScoringStrategiesFunctional1.footballExtraTimeScoringStrategy);

// For functional strategy 2
matchFunctional2.setScoringStrategyFunctional2(ScoringStrategyType.FOOTBALL_EXTRA_TIME);

// Updating score with the default scoring strategy
scoreboard.updateScore(match, 1, 0);

// Finishing a match and removing it from the active scoreboard****
scoreboard.finishMatch(match);

// Retrieving a summary of ongoing matches, sorted by total score and start time
List<MatchInterface> summary = scoreboard.getSummary();

// Create a Match and Register Observers
// Create teams
Team<FootballPlayer> homeFootballTeam = new FootballTeam.Builder().name("Home Football Team").build();
Team<FootballPlayer> awayFootballTeam = new FootballTeam.Builder().name("Away Football Team").build();

// Create a football match
FootballMatch footballMatch = (FootballMatch) footballMatchFactory.createMatchBuilder(homeFootballTeam, awayFootballTeam)
                                                   .scoringStrategyMode(ScoringStrategyMode.CLASSIC)
                                                   .build();

// Create and register an observer
MatchObserver matchObserver = new MatchObserver();
footballMatch.registerObserver(matchObserver);

// Add Events During the Match
// Simulate a goal event
FootballPlayer scorer = new FootballPlayer.Builder().name("John Doe").team(homeFootballTeam).build();
FootballPlayer assistant = new FootballPlayer.Builder().name("Jane Doe").team(homeFootballTeam).build();
((FootballEventManager)footballMatch.getEventManager()).addGoalEvent(scorer, assistant);

// Notify all observers about the goal event
footballMatch.notifyObservers(new MatchChangeEvent(footballMatch, EventType.GOAL));

// Using the Basketball Event Manager
// Create basketball teams
Team<BasketballPlayer> homeBasketballTeam = new BasketballTeam.Builder().name("Home Basketball Team").build();
Team<BasketballPlayer> awayBasketballTeam = new BasketballTeam.Builder().name("Away Basketball Team").build();

// Create a basketball match
MatchFactory<BasketballMatch> basketballMatchFactory = new BasketballMatchFactory();
BasketballMatch basketballMatch = (BasketballMatch) basketballMatchFactory.createMatchBuilder(homeBasketballTeam, awayBasketballTeam)
                                                        .build();

```

## Example: Using the Live Football World Cup Scoreboard Library

### Setting Up and Running a Football Match

This example demonstrates how to create a football match, score goals, end the match, and validate the outcomes using an observer to monitor events.

```java
package com.sportradar.exercise.match;

import com.sportradar.exercise.abstract_factory.FootballMatchFactory;
import com.sportradar.exercise.observer.MatchObserver;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;

public class FootballMatchUsageExample {
    private FootballMatchFactory factory;
    private Team<FootballPlayer> homeTeam;
    private Team<FootballPlayer> awayTeam;
    private FootballMatch match;
    private MatchObserver observer;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        // Initialize factory and create teams
        factory = new FootballMatchFactory();
        homeTeam = new Team.Builder<FootballPlayer>().name("Team A").build();
        awayTeam = new Team.Builder<FootballPlayer>().name("Team B").build();

        // Add players to teams
        homeTeam.addPlayer(new FootballPlayer.Builder().name("John Doe").team(homeTeam).build());
        awayTeam.addPlayer(new FootballPlayer.Builder().name("Joe Smith").team(awayTeam).build());

        // Create the match and register an observer
        match = factory.createMatchBuilder(homeTeam, awayTeam).build();
        observer = new MatchObserver();
        match.registerObserver(observer);
    }

    @Test
    public void testMatchFlow() {
        // Start the match
        match.startMatch();

        // Simulate scoring events
        match.scoreGoal(homeTeam.getRoster().get(0), null);
        match.scoreGoal(homeTeam.getRoster().get(0), null);

        // End the match
        match.finishMatch();

        // Assertions to ensure the match flowed as expected
        assertEquals("Expected number of events should be correct", 6, match.getEvents().size());
        MatchEvent<?> firstGoalEvent = match.getEvents().stream()
                .filter(e -> e.getEventType() == EventType.GOAL)
                .findFirst()
                .orElse(null);

        assertNotNull("Goal event should exist", firstGoalEvent);
        assertEquals("First goal should be scored by John Doe", "John Doe", firstGoalEvent.getInvolvedPlayers().get(0).getName());
        assertTrue("Observer should have received the event", observer.isEventReceived());
    }
}
```
### Explanation

#### Setup Phase
- **Teams and Players**: The teams (`Team A` and `Team B`) and players (`John Doe` and `Joe Smith`) are created using builders, ensuring detailed setup before the match begins.
- **Observer Registration**: A `MatchObserver` is initialized and registered to the match to monitor and react to various match events.

#### Match Execution
- **Starting the Match**: The match is initiated, transitioning from a non-started to an in-progress state.
- **Scoring Events**: John Doe scores two goals. These events are dynamically added to the match's event list.
- **Ending the Match**: The match is concluded, and its status is updated to finished.

#### Assertions
- **Event Verification**: The test confirms that six events were correctly logged (starting, two goals, and ending the match, with each goal triggering a score update).
- **Goal Event Details**: The details of the first goal event are examined to verify that John Doe is correctly recorded as the scorer.
- **Observer Notification**: It is verified that the observer received notifications, demonstrating the observer pattern's effectiveness within the library.

This example serves as a comprehensive guide for leveraging the Live Football Scoreboard Library to manage and monitor football matches effectively, showcasing real-world application of match setup, event handling, and observer notifications.
